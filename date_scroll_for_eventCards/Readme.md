Purpose: Design for allowing the date to be shown when scrolling event cards with minimal space usa

URL: Slack

Critical?: Yes, the cards currently do not display this information and version on the paper interface (from wayyyyy back) use too much space.

More Details: For each picture focus on how the date is displayed at the very top and how a line separates different dates
